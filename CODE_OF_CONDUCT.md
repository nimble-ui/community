# Code of Conduct

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to the following communication channels:
- Issues and pull requests in all repositories owned by this organizations
- Discussions
- Any other communication method for the following:
  - Development of software
  - Representing the NimbleUI community.

Any clarifications on scope can be asked in the Q&A.

## Standards of Communication

We expect all users to have constructive discussions between members,
and we expect members to gracefully accept other's viewpoints.

We will not accept the following:

- Harassment of individuals, groups, or other entities inside or outside the community
- Attempts to hurt the reputation(s) of others
- Being an inconvenience to other community members
  or obstructing activities relating to the development of NimbleUI
- Discriminatory behavior based on race, gender, disability, or any other attribute.

## Reporting Misconduct

If you see misconduct, add the following comment to inform all Administrators about the misconduct.

> @nimble-ui/admin

If reactions are enabled on the issue, pull request, or discussion thread,
a thumbs down (:-1:) *will* be treated as a report.

Administrators will do their best to promptly respond to misconduct,
but it is up to the community's members to report misconduct to an Administrator.
We would rather have one report too many than one report too few.

## Administrative Policies and Practices

Administrators will not take a report lightly; appropriate actions will be taken as needed, and the community member in question will be warned as deemed necessary by Administrators.

Diciplinary actions will range from a public warning, to a temporary user account ban, to a perminent user ban.
In the most severe cases, if a large amount of community members are in violation of the Code of Conduct, a temporary lockdown **will** be in effect.
