# Becoming a Core Member

The process for becoming a core member is straightforward; however, becoming a core member should not be taken lightly.
The contributor in question will apply to become a core member as follows:
1. go to the issue tracker in this repository
2. click `New issue`
3. click `Get started` next to the `Core Member Application` option
4. fill out the issue template.

The application will be reviewed by the core team, and the verdict will be given within five business days.

If the application was accepted, the member in question will [shadow](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/glossary/job-shadowing) other core members performing necessary roles.
New members will shadow existing members for seven days, and during this period, they can ask questions in the meeting room but they are not yet community administrators.

Once the shadowing period is complete, the member in question is ready to become an Administrator,
and the new member will be announced soon after if there are no community enforcement lockouts or public warnings in effect.

## About Administrators

Administrators are core members who have completed their shadowing and have not been suspended;
Administrators are also required to assist in enforcing the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Violation Committed by a Core Member

Core members who violate the Code of Conduct or mislabel content as violating the Code of Conduct will be met with [disciplinary actions](./org-policies/progressive_discipline.md).
