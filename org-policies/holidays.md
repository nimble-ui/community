# Holidays

Because this organization is international, and its members are volunteering their time, we do not observe a specific set of holidays. Because of this, in the spirit of anti-discrimination practices, we will allow members to take time off for a religious or national holiday. Legitimate holidays can be found [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/) by your country of residency.
