# Attendence Policy

## Policy brief & purpose

Our core member attendance policy outlines our expectations about our core members coming to work. Checking GitHub, Slack, and email notifications helps us increase productivity when maintaining the library.

## Scope

This organization's attendance policy applies to all nonexempt members regardless of position or type of employment.

## Policy elements

All members need to collaborate with their colleagues to do their job. To make this collaboration easier, we expect you to do the following:

- check in on all relevant Slack channels
- respond to issues and pull requests accordingly in all relevant repositories in a timely manner
- review pull request changes when requested to review them on all relevant repositories in a timely manner
- enforce the Code of Conduct in a timely manner

If you are absent or late on occasion, you should have a good reason.

Being consistently tardy or absent can cause problems to your colleagues who may have to shoulder your work. This behavior may bring about a “bad attendance” record and you may need to go through [progressive discipline](./progressive_discipline.md).

### What is absenteeism and tardiness?

Absenteeism refers to frequent absence from an member’s job responsibilities. This includes not coming to work frequently or using up too many sick days.

Presenteeism refers to being present at work beyond your schedule even when we don’t require overtime. This can cause you to overwork and have an impact on your productivity and job satisfaction.

Tardiness refers to coming in late. We probably won’t mind if you’re a bit late checking in. However, we want to make sure you generally follow your schedule and you don’t cause disruption in our workplace.

### Unforeseen Absences

If you cannot complete the required tasks in a timely manner, let all members know via the `#general` channel as soon as possible. Afterwards, you should draw from your remaining time off or sick leave to cover this absence. Please report that you are available again via the `#general` channel as quickly as possible. Unexcused or unreported absence for more than three days will be considered job abandonment.

We will understand if you have good reasons for being absent, even if you don’t report it. Those reasons usually involve serious accidents, family emergencies, or acute medical emergencies.

The following list, although not exhaustive, includes reasons that we *do* consider excused absence:

- Extreme weather conditions like blizzards, hurricanes, and floods.
- Family emergencies, such as a death or acute medical emergency in the family.
- Acute medical emergencies.
- [Approved holidays](./holidays.md).

*(Weekends are considered days off)*

## Leader’s Responsibility

If you were elected to lead the organization, you are responsible to monitor the attendance of all members. If you notice that a team member is consistently late or absent, arrange a private meeting or email to discuss. Ask your team member whether they experience issues with their schedule or whether they need help balancing their personal lives with work. Time management training options may provide a solution. If you perceive a possible mental health issue that results in absenteeism or tardiness, ask your team member to contact a mental health professional and discuss what you can do to help them.

If you suspect that your team member abuses their sick leave or is wilfully tardy, you should start a progressive discipline process.

## Disciplinary action

If the organization leader suspects you abuse your sick leave, you may need to submit doctor’s notes to avoid our progressive discipline process. If you’re being tardy unintentionally, corrective counseling will be our first attempt at a solution. We may take disciplinary action that goes up to and including termination if:

- Corrective counseling doesn’t work.
- We find that you are wilfully tardy.
- Your tardiness or absenteeism impacts your work.
