# Progressive Discipline

Our Progressive Discipline policy outlines the steps we will take to address an employeeâ€™s misconduct.

We recognize that people make mistakes and our employees may not always follow our policies closely. We want to give our employees a chance to correct their behavior when possible and assist them in the process. We also want to ensure that serious offenses are thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

## Scope

This policy applies to all our employees.

## Policy elements

Our disciplinary process has four steps of increasing strictness. These steps are:

1. Warning via Slack DM or email
2. Formal discussion
3. Final warning via Slack
4. Termination


Records of the process from step 1 onwards must be documented.

The leader must let members know when they launch a progressive discipline procedure. For example, pointing out a performance issue is not necessarily a verbal warning and may be part of the regular feedback a member receives. If the leader judges that a progressive disciplinary process is appropriate, they must clarify this to their team member and document the step.

## Explaining the Steps

### Step 1
The leader should issue a private warning first via Slack direct messaging (DM) then wait for 24 hours. Because Slack notifications can be snoozed, if 24 hours have passed since the warning was issued, re-issue it once more via email. The warning must tell the member what they did wrong and how it impacts the organization. If the behavior does not improve, the leader must switch to step 2.

### Step 2
The leader must email the member in question to set up a meeting on a private Slack channel. The following should be taken into account when discussing misconduct:

1. If the problem is related to [attendance](./attendance.md), suggest time management skills that the member can utilize.
2. If the problem is related to how much sick time is used, attempt to request the member's recent doctor's notes.
   **Note:** To comply with certain data protection laws, do not do this without a secure connection and erase the notes as soon as they are not needed!
3. If the problem involves the Code of Conduct, do not start a discussion and skip to step 4.

### Step 3
The leader gives a final warning to the member via the `#general` channel. This warning must tell the member that they did something wrong, and they will be let go if this incident happens again.

### Step 4
The leader will void the member's Core Member Application (CMA) and strip the member of their membership, meaning that they will lose access to the Slack workspace and private repositories; they will also only have read access in public repositories. For seven calendar days starting when their previous CMA was voided, The former member's future CMAs will be denied on the spot.

## How to Avoid Progressive Discipline

Disciplining an employee is never a pleasant task. For the sake of everyone involved, we will take actions to prevent the need for disciplinary action. We will:

- Communicate our policies and Code of Conduct clearly to all new hires.
- Announce any revisions or changes in our policies to all our employees in a formal manner (e.g. bulletins, newsletters.)
- Use frequent performance meetings to address issues before they become problems.
- Establish a culture of respect and collaboration.
