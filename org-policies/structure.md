# The Structure of the Organization

To increase efficiency while maintaining the library, the size of the organization must between six and twelve members. Fewer than six members will lead to members being spread relatively thin. More than twelve members will lead to members being less productive.

## Roles

Because of how small the library is, a generalized structure is optimal because if many members are not present, the development process will not be as affected as in a specialized structure. With a generalized structure, every member knows how the library works as a whole, which allows members to switch between tasks as needed.
