# The Structure of the Organization

To increase efficiency while maintaining the library, the size of the organization must between six and twelve members. Fewer than six members will lead to members being spread relatively thin. More than twelve members will lead to members being less productive.

## Roles

Because of how small the library is, a generalized structure is optimal because if many members are not present, the development process will not be as affected as in a specialized structure. With a generalized structure, every member knows how the library works as a whole, which allows members to switch between tasks as needed.

## The Organization Leader and Elections

Although every member has a voice, the leader of the organization is responsible for steering the development of the library. As such, the leader is equivalent to the development lead of any other software development team. With the approval of the rest of the organization, the leader also must amend policies as necesary to accomodate its members and adapt to changes from the outside world.

The leader is elected by a ranked-choice voting processm on the `#elections` channel, and an election occurrs...
- When the current leader wishes to step down.
- When a 2/3rd majority vote of impeachment is decided by all other members; this means that the leader needs disciplinary measures.
- When a 2/3rd majority vote of no confidence is decided by all other members.
- Every first business day in January and July.

### Access Rights
The leader and two other hand-picked members have administrative access to Slack and are promoted to become owners of the GitHub orgabization. The two other members will lose their access when a new leader is elected, and two other members will be chosen by the new leader.

### Incapacitated Leaders
To prevent the organization from losing control when the leader refuses to step down, two other members must be chosen to remove adminstrative access from the incapacitated leader. The leader is incapacitated when either there is a vote of no confidence or a vote of impeachment, and the leader does not relinquish their access in a timely manner.
